# Split-Keyboard


# Purpose:

Personally I spend around 12 hours every day on my computer either playing/studying/coding or building a project like this one. To think that i am spending half of my life in front of my computer is crazy but this is my future career of choice and what I am passionate about so to have a better time in the future while doing those things I am making this hackpad. On top of that i wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about electric components and hardware techs that is why on some days I learnt things about hardware that isn’t needed in a keyboard.
