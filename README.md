# Hackpad

# Purpose:

Personally I spend around 12 hours every day on my computer either playing/studying/coding or building a project like this one. To think that i am spending half of my life in front of my computer is crazy but this is my future career of choice and what I am passionate about so to have a better time in the future while doing those things I am making this hackpad. On top of that i wanted to take this opportunity to learn more about electric components and hardware techs that is why on some days I learnt things about hardware that isn’t needed in a keyboard.

### 📖Learning how to use Kicad:

Disclaimer —- For those who are looking for tips or tricks to learn Kicad quickly this is not a guide as this is my first time learning Kicad so i am just trying things out to see which one works and which don’t.

Following and trying to learn Kicad via youtube tutorial and hack club :

… Failed misserably.

Time spent 3 hours.

## Day 2 (2025.12.26)

Note: I realised that I wasn’t reallt learning while following a tutorial that is why I first made a plan and wrote down what I needed today. Also today I didn’t really work on the PCB just a bit of schematics and a lot of planning.

## Day 3 (2025.12.27)

Note: Today I watched a few videos on other people building their keyboards. During this time I decided to change my keyboard’s layout from the original design to a more mac compatible one.

I will add 2 knobs and RGB to this design. Also from the videos I learned that if I used third party apps such as ergogen it will make my life so much easier. (Credits to [**Christian Selig](https://www.youtube.com/@cselig)).**

## Day 4 (2025.12.28)

Note: Yesterday I said that ergogen will make my life so much easier. Umm….. Now I am starting to doubt that sentence as I can’t find any good tutorial that shows me this function does that etc… Still trying to learn ergogen I think I am getting the hang of it. Tutorial—-[Dénes Bán](https://www.youtube.com/@denesban)(This was the best one I found)

Update: So I just found out that I am not allowed to use ergogen for my PCB. Which is a bummer considering that I spent a day of work on trying to learn it

## Day 5(2025.12.29)

Note: Today I just spent a lot of time figuring out how to use the hackclub website and read a lot of comment and watched a lot of youtube videos for inspirations. I didn’t have much energy today so I tried to do something and try to maintain a relaxed state so I wouldn’t experience burn outs.

## Day 6(2025.12.30)

Note: So today from the hack club slack I found someone who was willing to help with my library issues. I’ve got to give credit to nosemicolon cause without him this project wouldn’t be possible. Thanks to him I have managed to complete 50% of my schematics today. (Hey no semicolon If you are reading this thanks a lot I am really grateful for your help.)

## Day 7(2025.12.31)

Note: I know that today is the last day of the year but I still wanna do this project cause I don’t want this project to be an another one of those new year new me stuff so I don’t lose interest , stop doing this project and lose this wonderful opportunity. 

Update: So I just completed doing my schematics with the help of a community member no semicolon. Now I am moving onto the PCB part. Which I am gonna have to do alone

## Day 8(2026.01.01)

Note: Its currently 1:31 in the middle of the night on 2026 January 1st. I just finished celebrating and now I am moving onto to the PCB again. I did the arrangement/alignment pretty neatly(i think) and now I am wiring them which is the most difficult part to be honest
