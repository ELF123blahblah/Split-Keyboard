# Note
The bottom one and the little rectangle will be printed with transparent PLA. To give it an underglow effect and make a window for the microcontrollers
I have the screws thats why i didnt include it in the BOM.
## Details
This hackpad is made to help me have a better time while programming, gaming and 3D printing things.
### BOM
- 9 Cherry MX Switches
- 12 SK6812 MINI LEDs
- 1 XIAO RP2040
- 9 Blank DSA Keycaps
- ~ 80g Normal PLA
- ~ 30g transparent PLA
Disclaimer:
The switches and the top part fits perfectly because of some issues on my macbook I can't upload the video/image onto my github repo so if you have any questions please contact me via slack so that I can show you how it is made myself and answer any questions
### My request for the staff:
Please don't require a full component assembled photo/file as it is way too much work that I need to remove all the stuff to print it and it didn't make a difference in the aligning part as well cause i just had to flip the top part and that's it.
